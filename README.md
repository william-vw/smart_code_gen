# Imperative Code Generation from Semantic Knowledge Graphs

## Material

- Scenario descriptions: [`Scenarios/`](Scenarios/)
- Input Semantic KG: [`Semantic KG/`](<Semantic KG/>)
- Generated smart contracts: [`Smart Contracts/`](<Smart Contracts/>)
- Evaluation results: [`Evaluation Results/`](<Evaluation Results/>)

## Instructions

Due to recurring latency issues with the Sepolia testnet, we've written comprehensive instructions on how to locally deploy and test the smart contracts. See [`Local Deployment`](<Local Deployment/>) for instructions!
