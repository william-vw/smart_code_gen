Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) provided in home: Medicare covers IVIG if you have a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease, and your doctor decides that it’s medically appropriate for you to get the IVIG in your home. Part B covers the IVIG itself, but doesn’t pay for other items and services related to you getting the IVIG at home.
