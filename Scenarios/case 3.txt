Injectable osteoporosis drugs: 
Medicare covers injectable osteoporosis drugs if you meet all of these conditions:
You’re a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
You have a bone fracture that a doctor certifies was related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
Your doctor certifies that you can’t give yourself the injection or learn how to give yourself the drug by injection.
In addition, Medicare will cover the home health nurse or aide to provide the injection if your family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to give you the drug by injection.
